# Implementation Checklist - Enhanced RAG Integration

## ‚úÖ Completed Requirements

### 1. Integrate RAG with Initial File Processing
- [x] Store document embeddings during initial file upload
- [x] Use stored embeddings for subsequent QA without re-upload  
- [x] Maintain file context in memory during the session
- [x] Cache processed documents for faster access (FAISS persistence)

**Implementation Details:**
- Modified `handle_extraction_tab()` to auto-populate knowledge base
- Added file tracking and batch RAG processing
- Knowledge base persisted to `data/vector_store/financial_kb`
- Session state stores QA service across page interactions

### 2. Enhanced Financial Statistics
- [x] Revenue analysis support (when historical data available)
- [x] Profitability metrics (gross margin, operating margin, net margin, ROIC)
- [x] Liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, working capital)
- [x] Efficiency metrics (inventory turnover, receivables turnover, asset turnover)
- [x] Investment metrics (ROE, ROA, ROIC)
- [x] Visualize financial trends with interactive charts
- [x] Add comparative analysis capabilities

**Implemented Metrics (16 total):**
1. Gross Profit Margin
2. Operating Profit Margin  
3. Net Profit Margin
4. Return on Assets (ROA)
5. Return on Equity (ROE)

7. Current Ratio
8. Quick Ratio
9. Cash Ratio ‚≠ê NEW
10. Working Capital Ratio ‚≠ê NEW
11. Debt-to-Equity Ratio
12. Debt Ratio ‚≠ê NEW
